Hello there!

Welcome everyone! Let's get started!

Now first things first, my name is Patrick Pichler and I am currently employed at Dynatrace as a
Product Security Engineer.

Originally I started my career as a Java Software Developer, but everything changed when I stumbled
upon Linux and the cloud. This definitely transformed me into a full-on Linux nerd. I *used* arch
btw. Do not question why I am currently on a Macbook though.

With this out of the way, let me ask you some quick questions. Who of you here has heard of
Distroless before? Who of has heard about Chainguard images?

Ok nice, for all of you who do not know neither of them, buckle your seatbelt as this will be one
heck of a ride.

Today we are going to containerize a small application, with various technologies. Let's pray to the
demo gods, that everything will workout fine üôè.

Introducing our demo app for today: vulnerable-awk-playground.

This application provides a basic REST API designed to test AWK scripts against provided text. AWK
is a versatile programming language and command-line utility for text processing. It is known for
its pattern scanning and processing capabilities. However, there's a crucial issue: the original
developer overlooked the fact that AWK features various way of executing binaries.

It requires an AWK binary to be present on the system to run.

Admittedly, this example might seem somewhat contrived, but it serves well for our demonstration
purposes.

Let's dive right into containerizing the application then.

We start by using a simple Dockerfile approach. Since we will be building the app as part of
the Dockerfile, we start with the `golang:1.21.3-bookworm` image. We then copy over the files
we need, invoke the compiler, move the binary to `/usr/bin` and finally set the entrypoint to
`vulnerable-awk-playground`.

Take a look at the resulting Dockerfile. It is pretty straight forward. Time to build the image.
Alright, didn't take too long. Now, care to guess the size of the resulting image? Any suggestions?
A whopping `1.01GB`. The base image adds a hefty `822MB`. But fear not, we can do a lot better.

We can step up our game with a nifty Docker feature called multi stage builds. Instead of cramming
the complete go build toolchain in the resulting runtime image (not that we need it anyway), there
is a second image just for building. Then we just copy over the binary. This will decrease the image
size by quite a bit.

Let's give it a shot and tweak our Dockerfile. First up, toss an `as` label at the end of the first
`FROM` directive. We call the first image `build`. Next we introduce a second `FROM`. `ubuntu:23.10`
should do the job just fine. Nice, it hopefully will result in a smaller image size. All that is
left to do, is to add the command for copying over the `vulnerable-awk-playground` binary. Voila, we
are done. We can build the image now. Nice! The resulting image has `101MB`. Still not great, but
way better than `1.01GB`.

Another quick win would be to replace `ubuntu` with `alpine`. `alpine`, for all of you who do not
know it, is a minimal Linux Distribution. It is often used as a base image for containers. Lets
replace `ubuntu` and build the image. Now look at that. The resulting image, only has `15.3MB`. You
heard that right `15MB`, vs the `101MB` with `ubuntu`.

Believe it or not, we can even do better in regards to size. While `alpine` is already pretty minimal
in the amount of things it ships by default, it still contains the `apk` package manager binary.
Our application only depends on `awk`, so this is just dead weight.


There is a special kind of base images, called distroless. The two most known distroless image
projects are `distroless` and `chainguard-images`. `distroless` is maintained by Google and is
based on a strip to the bare version of debian. It offers various flavors for different, such as
`static`, which contains only bare minimum files, such as SSL certificates, `Java`, which features
a JRE installed, `Python` and nodejs.

`chainguard-images` on the other hand, are maintained by Chainguard. They offer a wide selection of
different images, ranging from tools such as `ArgoCD` over `Nginx`, to language images for `Golang`
as well as `NodeJS`. Chainguard-images are based on `Wolfi`.

`What on earth is wolfi?` I already hear you ask. `wolfi` is a distribution maintained also by
Chainguard. The magic part of it is, that it leverages the `apk` package manager, but instead of
using upstream `alpine` packages, it has its own.

Since `vulnerable-awk-playground` has a hard dependency on `awk`, we are going to use the
`cgr.dev/chainguard/busybox:latest` base image. By now you should know the drill. Replace the base
image, build it and check out the image size. `14.5MB` nice! By this point the image size win are
insignificant over `alpine`. The `chainguard` based image is a whopping `69` times smaller than the
image we started out with! Pretty Nice!

Building containers with Dockerfiles is pretty easy. It sadly also has a lot of foot guns.

We now switch to a somewhat contrived example of a Dockerfile. We write some secret into some file
and delete it later. Just imaging instead of the secret being `super-secure`, it is some private ssh
key and we are using it to checkout our super secret magic sauce code from our Github repositories.
If we build the container image and run it, the `/etc/secret.txt` file no longer exists. If you
have worked a lot with containers you probably already know where this is heading, but if you are
somewhat new to the whole container world, this might be confusing. What if I tell you, the end user
of the container image still has access to the secret?

Before I explain you how, we need a bit of theory about the parts that make up a container image.

Nowadays, there are two established container image formats out there. The Docker Image Spec and
the OCI Image spec.

The Docker Image spec specifies a JSON based configuration format, that is specially geared towards
Docker and running containers. Even though it is well adopted outside docker by the container
ecosystem, there are still some things that are left to be desired to enable a broader range of use
cases. To ensure compatibility between those new emerging tools, the OCI was founded.

OCI stands for Open Container Initiative and it was founded back in 2015 by Docker and other leaders
in the container ecosystem. It also is using a JSON based configuration format and is considered an
industry standard for container images. It is designed to be able to cover a large variety of
use-cases, which for example include storing binaries in container registries.

The Docker Image Spec and OCI Image have a lot of similarities, as they have a large overlap in
usage. What I am going to explain now is more or less true for both, but we will use the Docker
image format, as it is easier to export images from docker that way.

In a nutshell a container image is simply a tar ball containing a `manifest.json` that describes
things such as a config file, as well as the layers, that make up the container. All layers are
then also stored as tar balls in the image.

Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a new layer. In our example, there will be `4` layers
created. In the end a layer is once again a tar ball containing files and folders. When you then
create a container from that image, you can imagine the container runtime extracting all files from
the tar balls one by one in the order specified by the `manifest.json`. This is not exactly what is
happening, but it is good enough to for now.

All of this works pretty fine for adding new files in layers. Deleting a file is a bit more tricky.
Let's have a look at the Docker image spec. It says that file deletion are handled by special
whiteout files. They are empty files, with the same name as the file to delete, only to be prefixed
by `.wh.`. In our docker example this means, that the layer created by running the `rm` command will
contain a single empty file in the `etc` folder called `.wh.secret.txt`.

Let's see all of this in action, by simply exporting our container image by running `docker image
save insecure-layer-sample:latest -o image.tar`. Next we untar the file. The `manifest.json` tells
us, that we need to look at the xxxxx file, as it is the last layer in our image. Opening the
`xxxxx/layer.tar` file reveals the empty whiteout file under the `etc` folder.

To head back to our questions, so how can the end user then still see the password?
Let's check out the second layer and who would have thought, it contains our secret.

While there certainly are ways of solving this issue in Dockerfiles, namely using secret mounts,
there also exist better solutions for building container images, in my opinion. If you for example
build a Java Service, I can highly recommend Jib. Jib can magically transform your Java service
into an container image, by simply adding it as a gradle/maven plugin to your build script. It even
goes as far as optimizing your image layers, to keep image build times low. Another very nice plus
point for Jib is, that it does not require a Docker daemon for building. This means it is trivial to
integrate into your CI pipelines.

If you are building a Golang service like we do, there is a similar tool called `ko`. You simply run
`ko build` and there you have an optimized container image for your application.

Both of those tools are pretty specialized tools for either Golang or Java. Both allow you to
specify the base images of the resulting containers. There also exists another handy tool. It is
called `apko`, is open source and was created by our friends over at Chainguard. All of the
Chainguard images are actually build via `apko`.

`apko` allows you specify in a declarative way what packages should be part of the resulting image.
As the name already implies, it leverages the same package format as `apk`. This means you can
easily build images with packages from both wolfi and alpine upstream repos.

The best part of `apko` then is, that it makes it trivial to build images only containing the
strictly necessary parts you need. Each installed package in an container image will increase its
attack surface. Of course, a critical vulnerability in for example VIM can only be exploited, if an
attacker manages to executes commands in our container. For this we need to have a RCE or command
injection vulnerability. Each package then could act as the next link in the attackers attack chain
to take over our service.

Another very nice side effect of having only the absolutely necessary packages installed, is the
reduce CVE notification fatigue caused by image scanners. As mentioned before, do you really care
that VIM is vulnerable in your container image?

For example, let's compare the number of CVEs found in the various images we built today for the
`vulnerable-awk-playground`. We will use `trivy` for that job. All we need to run is `trivy image`
and pass it the image we want to scan. Here are the results (stand 12.11.2023):

| Image                                                 | Vulnerability Count |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| vulnerable-awk-playground:all-in-one.json             | 326                 |
| vulnerable-awk-playground:multi-stage-ubuntu.json     | 13                  |
| vulnerable-awk-playground:multi-stage-alpine.json     | 4                   |
| vulnerable-awk-playground:multi-stage-chainguard.json | 0                   |

We have a clear winner here. There is not a single vulnerability found in the chainguard version of
our containerized application. I guess this is all that is required to say here.

Back to `apko`. As bad luck would have it, `vulnerable-awk-playground` is susceptible to RCE and
command injection. Let's transform it to only contain the absolute minimum of packages installed.
A quick reminder, we have a hard dependency on `AWK`.

There is already the first problem. `apko` can only install `APK` packages. How can we turn
`vulnerable-awk-playground` into an `APK`?

Meet the second amazing open source tool created by Chainguard: `melange`. With `melange` building
`APK` packages is trivial. All you need to do is to once again specify how to build your app in an
declarative way and you are good to go.

Enough talk, lets get this `APK` party started.

I already have `apko` and `melange` installed on my system. We start out by creating the APK
package. For this we create a `melange.yaml`, specify some metadata, such as the name, setup which
packages for our build environment are required and define a build pipeline. The pipeline itself is
rather straight forward as Golang is pretty easy to build. Nice! Let's create a package signing key
by running `melange keygen` and create the APK package by running the `melange build` command. I am
using the `docker` runner + some custom settings, since I am on MacOS. If I would run a proper OS
like Linux, I could even make use of bubblewrap, which would allow us to build the package without
requiring higher privileges.

With the build done, we now have the APK added to the `packages` folder.

Next up, lets build our image. For this we create an `apko.yaml` file. First we need to specify
the keyring that our build trusts when installing packages. We also need to declare a set of
repositories `apko` will use to get APK packages from, as well as the packages we want installed in
our image. We use the standard wolfi repo, as well as our local `packages` folder, which contains
the result of the `melange` build, we did before. Next up, we setup the accounts used. It is best
practice to not run your containers as root, hence we create a `nobody` user. Last, but not least,
we specify the entrypoint. Here we simply run `vulnerable-awk-playground`. This should be it!
Building the image is as simple as running `apko build`. This leaves us with a tar ball of the
image. We can import it via the `docker load` command. Let's check for the image size by running
`docker image ls`. It has `20.8MB`, not too bad. It is a bit larget than the chainguard busybox
based image though. What about vulnerabilities? Trivy repots **0** vulnerabilities. This is amazing.
Also exploitation just has become harder. The container doesn't even have a shell installed.

Having a minimal container image is not a silver bullet though. Did you know that you can create a
reverse shell via AWK? To further harden your service, you should apply a strategy called
defense in depth. In a nutshell you can think of it like a medieval castle. Instead of having a
single wall around it, they had multiple layers of defenses. Be it a moat with a draw bridge,
or multiple rings of walls. Back in devops land, this pretty much translates to having security
not just at your application level, but also in the container itself, as well as the underlying
infrastructure. Defense in Depth could pretty much be a talk on its own, but here are some tips on
how to further harden your services.

The most impactful change you should make is, to not run your applications as the root user. If an
attacker manages to escape the container, by running as root in the container, they will have root
outside of the container. This is not universally true, as rootless container runtimes exists, but
all in all, creating a dedicated user for your app in the image is the best practice way.

Additionally, try to run your containers only with the absolute minimum of capabilities required by
your services. For example, running our `vulnerable-awk-playground` as a container with the
`--privileged` flag would be a recipe for disaster. For an attacker it would then be trivial to
escape from the container, by e.g. loading a kernel module.

Next, when running the container, make sure it has a read only file system. This makes it once again
harder for attackers to for example download a crypto miner. There are still ways around this, but
they will create more noise and are hence more probable to be detected.

Another very important tip, only use host mounts, if there is no way around them. Host volume
mounts, or host path mounts in k8s, punch a hole through the isolation we get from containers right
to the underlying host. There have already been numerous vulnerabilities with host paths, where it
allowed processes within containers to read arbitrary files on the host.

Let's sum up what we have learned today.

* You can improve your container image size by quite a bit, when putting some thought into what base
image to use
* While Dockerfiles seem simple, they can cause you a lot of headaches
* There exists good alternatives for Dockerfiles
* Think about defense in depth, when running your services

If you would like to learn more about securely building containers or container security in general,
I would recommend you hit over to my blog at patrickpichler.dev. It currently looks a bit empty, but
trust me, I have some very interesting articles lined up. Additionally, I can highly recommend you
to checkout the book `Container Security` by Liz Rice. It is an amazing resource touching on all
kinds of container security related topics.

I hope you enjoyed the talk and if you have any questions, remarks or whatever, feel free to
